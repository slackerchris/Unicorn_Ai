## 🚀 Next Steps - Choose Your Provider

### **Quick Option: Replicate (5 minutes)**

1. **Sign up:** https://replicate.com
2. **Get API token:** https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
3. **Add to config:**
   ```bash
   nano config/.env
   ```
   Add:
   ```
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   IMAGE_PROVIDER=replicate
   ```
4. **Restart services:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "python main.py"
   pkill -f "python telegram_bot.py"
   /home/chris/Documents/Git/Projects/Unicorn_Ai/venv/bin/python main.py > outputs/logs/api.log 2>&1 &
   sleep 2
   /home/chris/Documents/Git/Projects/Unicorn_Ai/venv/bin/python telegram_bot.py > outputs/logs/telegram_bot.log 2>&1 &
   ```
5. **Test on Telegram:** "Send me a selfie!"

**Cost:** ~$0.005 per image (very cheap for testing)

### **Self-Hosted Option: ComfyUI (Later)**

We can install ComfyUI whenever you're ready:
- Completely free
- Fully private
- Takes 1-2 hours to setup
- ~15-20GB disk space

## 🎯 How It Works Now

```
User → Telegram: "Send me a selfie!"
        ↓
Luna: "Sure! Let me take one 😊 [IMAGE: selfie, smiling]"
        ↓
System detects [IMAGE: ...]
        ↓
Provider generates image (Replicate or ComfyUI)
        ↓
Image appears in Telegram! 📸
```

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Test with Replicate first:**
1. Super quick to set up
2. See if you like the feature
3. Costs pennies to test
4. Can switch to ComfyUI later

**Then install ComfyUI when:**
- You're happy with how images work
- Want unlimited free generations
- Want complete privacy
- Have time for 1-2 hour setup

---

## 🧪 Testing Without Provider

You can test the system logic even without a provider:

```bash
# Test chat detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Can you send me a photo?"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

Look for:
- `"has_image": true`
- `"image_prompt": "..."`

This shows the detection works! Just needs a provider to actually generate.

## 📈 What's Next?

**Option 1:** Set up Replicate and test images (15 minutes)  
**Option 2:** Install ComfyUI for self-hosting (1-2 hours)  
**Option 3:** Move to Phase 4 (Voice) and come back to images later  
**Option 4:** Take a break - you've built a LOT today!

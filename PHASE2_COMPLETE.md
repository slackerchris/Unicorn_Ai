## 💡 My Recommendation

**Test Phase 2 first!**

1. Create your bot token (5 min)
2. Start the bot
3. Chat with Luna for a bit
4. See how you like it
5. Then decide what feature to add next

**Images (Option A)** is probably the most impactful next step. Having her send actual photos makes it feel much more real.

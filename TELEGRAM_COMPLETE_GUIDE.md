## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Telegram Bot (5 minutes)

1. **Open Telegram** (on your phone or desktop)

2. **Search for:** `@BotFather`
   - This is Telegram's official bot for creating bots
   - The real one has a blue checkmark ‚úì

3. **Start a chat** and send: `/newbot`

4. **Choose a name** (shown to users):
   - Example: `Unicorn AI`
   - Example: `Luna`
   - Example: `My AI Companion`

5. **Choose a username** (must end in 'bot'):
   - Example: `unicorn_ai_bot`
   - Example: `chris_luna_bot`
   - Example: `myai_companion_bot`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Username must be unique across all of Telegram

6. **Copy your token** - BotFather will give you something like:
   ```
   1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz-1234567
   ```
   
   **IMPORTANT:** Keep this secret! It's like a password.

---

### Step 2: Add Token to Your Config (2 minutes)

1. **Edit your config file:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/chris/Documents/Git/Projects/Unicorn_Ai
   nano config/.env
   ```

2. **Find the line:**
   ```
   # TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

3. **Replace it with** (use YOUR token):
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz-1234567
   ```
   (Remove the `#` at the start!)

4. **Save and exit:**
   - Press `Ctrl+X`
   - Press `Y` (yes)
   - Press `Enter`

---

### Step 3: Start Your AI Companion (1 minute)

1. **Run the start script:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/chris/Documents/Git/Projects/Unicorn_Ai
   ./start_telegram.sh
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   ```
   ü¶Ñ Starting Unicorn AI...
   Starting API backend...
   ‚úÖ API backend is running
   Starting Telegram bot...
   ‚úÖ Unicorn AI is now online!
   
   üì± Open Telegram and find your bot
   üí¨ Send /start to begin chatting
   ```

3. **If you see errors:**
   - Check `outputs/logs/api.log` for API errors
   - Check `outputs/logs/telegram.log` for bot errors
   - Make sure your token is correct in `config/.env`

---

### Step 4: Chat on Telegram! (Now!)

1. **Open Telegram** (phone or desktop)

2. **Search for your bot** (the username you created)
   - Example: `@unicorn_ai_bot`

3. **Start a chat** and send: `/start`

4. **You should see a welcome message from Luna!**

5. **Start chatting!**
   - "Hi Luna! How are you?"
   - "Tell me about yourself"
   - "I had a rough day..."
   - "Send me a selfie" (she'll respond in text for now)
   - Anything you want!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond:

# Check if services are running
ps aux | grep python

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restart everything
./stop_services.sh
./start_telegram.sh
```

### "Invalid token" error:
- Check that you copied the ENTIRE token from BotFather
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after the token in .env
- Make sure you removed the `#` from the start of the line

### "Can't connect" errors:
- Make sure Ollama is running: `systemctl status ollama`
- Make sure API started: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check logs: `tail -50 outputs/logs/api.log`

### Slow responses:
- First response is always slower (model loading)
- Subsequent responses should be 2-4 seconds
- Check GPU usage: `rocm-smi`

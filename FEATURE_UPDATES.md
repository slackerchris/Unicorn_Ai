# Feature Updates - Chat History & Sessions

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Summary
Implemented three major features requested by user:
1. âœ… Model indicator in chat UI
2. âœ… Chat history persistence
3. âœ… Multiple chat sessions

---

## 1. Model Display in Chat UI

**Problem:** When changing the LLM model in persona settings, there was no visual feedback showing which model was being used.

**Solution:** 
- Added model name display in chat message metadata
- Shows as "ðŸ¤– model-name" alongside response time
- Backend already correctly uses `persona.model` field
- Frontend now receives and displays the model from API response

**Files Modified:**
- `static/app.js` - Added `model` field to message options, display in `renderMessage()`
- `main.py` - Already returns model in ChatResponse

**Result:** Users can now see which LLM model generated each response

---

## 2. Chat History Persistence

**Problem:** Refreshing the page lost all conversation history.

**Solution:**
- Implemented localStorage-based chat history
- Saves all messages with full metadata (text, images, timestamps, model, etc.)
- Automatically saves after each message
- Loads on page refresh
- Per-session storage (see #3 below)

**Functions Added:**
- `saveChatHistory()` - Saves messages to localStorage with session-specific key
- `loadChatHistory()` - Loads and re-renders messages on startup
- Updated `clearChat()` - Now also clears localStorage for current session
- Updated `addMessage()` - Auto-saves after adding message

**Files Modified:**
- `static/app.js` - Added history save/load functions
- `static/app.js` - Modified `init()` to call `loadChatHistory()`

**Result:** Conversations persist across browser refreshes

---

## 3. Multiple Chat Sessions

**Problem:** Could only have one conversation. Switching topics or personas required clearing chat.

**Solution:**
- Full session management system with UI
- Each session has unique ID, name, timestamp, message count
- Sessions stored in localStorage
- Can create, switch, and delete sessions
- Chat history is per-session (separate storage keys)
- UI shows active session highlighted
- Session metadata updates automatically

**Functions Added:**
- `loadSessions()` - Load all sessions from localStorage
- `saveSessions()` - Save sessions metadata
- `getCurrentSessionId()` - Get or create current session
- `createNewSession()` - Creates new session with auto-generated name
- `switchToSession(sessionId)` - Switch between sessions, save/load chat
- `deleteSession(sessionId)` - Delete session (with protection for last session)
- `renameSession(sessionId, newName)` - Rename session (future feature)
- `renderSessionsList()` - Render sessions UI with active indicator

**UI Changes:**
- Added "Chat Sessions" section to sidebar
- "New Session" button
- Session list showing:
  - Session name
  - Message count
  - Last updated date
  - Delete button (per session)
  - Active indicator (highlighted)
- Click session to switch

**Files Modified:**
- `static/index.html` - Added sessions section HTML
- `static/style.css` - Added session item styling
- `static/app.js` - Complete session management system
- `static/app.js` - Updated constructor to use sessions
- `static/app.js` - Modified history functions to be session-aware

**Result:** Users can have multiple separate conversations, switch between them, and each maintains its own history

## Technical Details

### LocalStorage Keys:
- `unicornAI_sessions` - Array of session metadata
- `unicornAI_currentSession` - ID of active session
- `unicornAI_chatHistory_{sessionId}` - Chat history per session

### Session Data Structure:
```javascript
{
    id: "web_1728200000_abc123",
    name: "Chat 1",
    created: "2025-10-06T12:00:00.000Z",
    lastUpdated: "2025-10-06T12:30:00.000Z",
    messageCount: 15
}
```

### Chat History Data Structure:
```javascript
{
    messages: [
        {
            sender: "user" | "ai",
            text: "message text",
            timestamp: "2025-10-06T12:00:00.000Z",
            persona: "luna",
            hasImage: false,
            imagePrompt: null,
            imageUrl: null,
            responseTime: "2.3",
            model: "dolphin-mistral:latest"
        }
    ],
    persona: "luna",
    sessionId: "web_1728200000_abc123",
    lastUpdated: "2025-10-06T12:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## User Impact

**Before:**
- No way to see which model was used
- Lost all chat on refresh
- Could only have one conversation
- Had to clear chat to start fresh topic

**After:**
- âœ… Model name shown with each response
- âœ… Conversations saved automatically
- âœ… Can have unlimited separate chats
- âœ… Switch between topics instantly
- âœ… Each session maintains its own memory context

## Summary

All three requested features have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing. The system now provides a much more professional and usable chat interface with proper session management and persistence.

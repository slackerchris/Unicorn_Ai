# ‚úÖ ComfyUI Models - System Configuration

## üìä Current Status: READY TO USE!

You **already have 27GB of AI models** installed at:
```
~/.local/share/ComfyUI/
```

This project is now configured to **use those existing models** - no need to download duplicates!

---

## üé® Available Models

### Main Checkpoints (in `~/.local/share/ComfyUI/checkpoints/`):

1. **sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors** (6.5GB)
   - Stable Diffusion XL Base
   - High quality, versatile
   - Great for realistic images

2. **colossusProjectFlux_v12HephaistosFP8UNET.safetensors** (12GB)
   - Flux model (newer architecture)
   - Very high quality
   - Advanced features

3. **bosnianBaklavaV1_v1.safetensors** (2.2GB)
   - Specialized model
   - Custom trained

### Supporting Models:
- ‚úÖ CLIP Vision models (for image understanding)
- ‚úÖ Additional models in various directories

**Total: 5 model files, 27GB**

---

## üîß Configuration

### How It Works:

1. **Project ComfyUI** (in this repo):
   - Minimal installation (~500MB)
   - No models stored locally
   - Clean git repository

2. **System ComfyUI** (at `~/.local/share/ComfyUI/`):
   - All models stored here (27GB)
   - Shared across projects
   - Referenced via `extra_model_paths.yaml`

3. **Configuration File** (`comfyui/extra_model_paths.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   system_comfyui:
       base_path: /home/chris/.local/share/ComfyUI/
       checkpoints: checkpoints/
       # ... points to all model directories
   ```

### What This Means:
- ‚úÖ No duplicate downloads needed
- ‚úÖ Project folder stays small
- ‚úÖ Fast startup
- ‚úÖ Models can be shared with other projects

---

## üöÄ Testing

Start ComfyUI and verify it can see the models:

```bash
# Start all services
bash start_all.sh

# Or just ComfyUI
bash start_comfyui.sh
```

Then open: http://localhost:8188

You should see all 3 checkpoint models available in the model selector!

---

## üì¶ Adding More Models

If you need additional models, download them to the system location:

```bash
# Download to system ComfyUI
cd ~/.local/share/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/

# Example: Download a new model
wget https://huggingface.co/model-name/resolve/main/model.safetensors
```

They'll automatically be available to all projects using ComfyUI!

---

## üîÑ Model Management

### View all models:
```bash
ls -lh ~/.local/share/ComfyUI/checkpoints/
```

### Check disk usage:
```bash
du -sh ~/.local/share/ComfyUI/
```

### Delete unused models:
```bash
# Remove a specific model
rm ~/.local/share/ComfyUI/checkpoints/model_name.safetensors
```

---

## üí° Benefits of This Setup

### Before (without configuration):
- Each project downloads its own models
- 27GB √ó number of projects
- Wasted disk space
- Slow git operations

### After (with external models):
- Models stored once (27GB total)
- Project size: ~100MB
- Fast git operations
- Easy to manage

---

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### For Unicorn AI (this project):
1. ‚úÖ Already configured to use system models
2. ‚úÖ Start with `bash start_all.sh`
3. ‚úÖ ComfyUI will find models automatically

### For image generation:
- Use **sd_xl_base_1.0** for general images
- Use **colossusProjectFlux_v12** for highest quality
- Use **bosnianBaklavaV1** for specialized content

### For other projects:
1. Copy `comfyui/extra_model_paths.yaml` to new project
2. Same models work everywhere
3. No re-downloading needed

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### ComfyUI can't find models:
```bash
# Verify extra_model_paths.yaml exists
cat comfyui/extra_model_paths.yaml

# Check models are accessible
ls ~/.local/share/ComfyUI/checkpoints/
```

### Wrong models showing up:
- ComfyUI will show both local AND system models
- System models will be available to all projects

### Need different models:
- Download to `~/.local/share/ComfyUI/checkpoints/`
- They'll appear automatically

## üìù Summary

| Item | Status | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| **System Models** | ‚úÖ 27GB | `~/.local/share/ComfyUI/` |
| **Configuration** | ‚úÖ Set up | `comfyui/extra_model_paths.yaml` |
| **SDXL Base** | ‚úÖ Available | System checkpoints |

## Persona System Prompt

When you create a persona, the system automatically generates a prompt based on your inputs. Here's what it includes:

```
You are {NAME}, {DESCRIPTION}.

PERSONALITY TRAITS:
{traits}

SPEAKING STYLE:
{speaking_style}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only respond as {NAME} - never write the user's part
- Give ONE response, then STOP
- Don't continue the conversation by yourself
- Don't write "User:" or make up what the user says

TEXTING STYLE:
- Keep it SHORT (1-2 sentences, like texting)
- Be casual and natural
- Use emojis sparingly
- One message at a time

SENDING IMAGES:
- You can send photos by including [IMAGE: description]
- Only include [IMAGE: ...] when it makes sense
- Keep image descriptions simple

Be yourself and stay in character!
```

## Advanced: Programmatic Persona Creation

### Create Multiple Personas from a Script

```python
import requests

personas = [
    {
        "id": "motivator",
        "name": "Motivator Max",
        "description": "An energetic motivational coach",
        "personality_traits": ["energetic", "positive", "encouraging"],
        "speaking_style": "High energy! Lots of enthusiasm! üí™",
        "voice": "en-US-GuyNeural",
        "temperature": 0.95
    },
    {
        "id": "analyst",
        "name": "Data Analyst Dana",
        "description": "A logical data analysis expert",
        "personality_traits": ["analytical", "precise", "thorough"],
        "speaking_style": "Clear and data-driven, focuses on facts",
        "voice": "en-US-JennyNeural",
        "temperature": 0.6
    }
]

for persona in personas:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/personas/create",
        json=persona
    )
    print(f"Created: {persona['name']} - {response.status_code}")
```

### Generate Personas from User Preferences

```python
def create_persona_from_preferences(role, traits, style_keywords):
    """
    Generate a persona based on user preferences.
    """
    persona_id = role.lower().replace(" ", "-")
    
    # Map traits to speaking style
    style_map = {
        "formal": "Professional and structured, minimal emojis",
        "casual": "Relaxed and friendly, occasional emojis",
        "energetic": "Upbeat and enthusiastic! Lots of energy! üî•",
        "calm": "Peaceful and thoughtful, measured responses"
    }
    
    speaking_style = " ".join([style_map.get(k, "") for k in style_keywords])
    
    return {
        "id": persona_id,
        "name": role.title(),
        "description": f"A {', '.join(traits)} {role.lower()}",
        "personality_traits": traits,
        "speaking_style": speaking_style,
        "voice": "en-US-AriaNeural",
        "temperature": 0.8
    }

# Example usage
persona = create_persona_from_preferences(
    role="Career Coach",
    traits=["supportive", "experienced", "strategic"],
    style_keywords=["formal", "encouraging"]
)

requests.post("http://localhost:8000/personas/create", json=persona)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Persona already exists"
- Use a different ID
- Or delete the existing persona first

### Persona doesn't behave as expected
- Try adjusting temperature
- Make speaking style more specific
- Add more personality traits
- Increase or decrease max_tokens

### Voice doesn't sound right
- Try different voices from the list
- Each voice has unique characteristics
- Match voice gender/accent to persona

### Responses are too short/long
- Adjust max_tokens setting
- Modify speaking style to emphasize brevity/detail

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Create a basic persona first, then refine
2. **Test Extensively** - Chat with the persona to see if it matches your vision
3. **Be Descriptive** - More detail = better results
4. **Use Examples** - Include example phrases in speaking style
5. **Iterate** - Delete and recreate until you get it right
6. **Save Configs** - Keep JSON files of your best personas
7. **Share** - Export and share persona configs with others

---

## Export/Import Personas

### Export a Persona

Persona JSON files are stored in `data/personas/`:

```bash
cat data/personas/echo.json
```

### Import a Persona

Copy a JSON file to `data/personas/` and restart the server:

```bash
cp my-persona.json data/personas/
pkill -f "python main.py"
python main.py
```

## FAQ

A: Unlimited! (Limited only by disk space)

**Q: Can I edit existing personas?**
A: Not yet via UI, but you can edit the JSON files directly or delete and recreate.

**Q: Can I share my personas?**
A: Yes! Export the JSON file and share it.

**Q: Do personas have separate conversation histories?**
A: Not currently - all personas share the same conversation context in a session.

**Q: Can I use custom voices?**
A: Currently limited to Microsoft Edge TTS voices. Custom voice cloning may be added later.

**Q: What's the difference between temperature settings?**

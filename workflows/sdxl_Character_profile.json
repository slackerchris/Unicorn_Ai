Each Step will add (positive) or remove (negative) pixels based on what stable diffusion \"thinks\" should be there according to the model's training\n - cfg = This is how much you want SDXL to adhere to the prompt. Lower CFG gives you more creative but often blurrier results. Higher CFG (recommended max 10) gives you stricter results according to the CLIP prompt. If the CFG value is too high, it can also result in \"burn-in\" where the edges of the picture become even stronger, often highlighting details in unnatural ways.\n - sampler_name = This is the sampler type, and unfortunately different samplers and schedulers have better results with fewer steps, while others have better success with higher steps. This will require experimentation on your part!\n - scheduler = The algorithm/method used to choose the timesteps to denoise the picture.\n - start_at_step = This is the step number the KSampler will start out it's process of de-noising the picture or \"removing the random noise to reveal the picture within\". The first KSampler usually starts with Step 0. Starting at step 0 is the same as setting denoise to 1.0 in the regular Sampler node.\n - end_at_step = This is the step number the KSampler will stop it's process of de-noising the picture. If there is any remaining leftover noise and return_with_leftover_noise is enabled, then it will pass on the left over noise to the next KSampler (assuming there is another one)."],"color":"#432","bgcolor":"#653"},{"id":19,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[1558.4725341796875,553.4407958984375],"size":[565.77001953125,596.3800048828125],"flags":{},"order":24,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"images","name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":28},{"localized_name":"filename_prefix","name":"filename_prefix","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"filename_prefix"},"link":null}],"outputs":[],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.33"},"widgets_values":["ComfyUI"]},{"id":51,"type":"PrimitiveNode","pos":[-458.9957580566406,-76.71602630615234],"size":[300,160],"flags":{},"order":16,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"STRING","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"slot_index":0,"links":[45,47]}],"title":"Positive Prompt (Text)","properties":{"Run widget replace on values":false},"widgets_values":["masterpiece, best quality, ultra-detailed, photorealistic, 8k uhd, professional photography, RAW photo, dslr, 85mm lens, f/1.8,\n(Luna Lovegood:1.2), (age 11-14:1.1), (young girl:1.1), (dreamy and innocent expression:1.1), slightly wide-eyed, curious gaze,\nlong straight dirty blonde hair, slightly messy, parted on the side,\nwearing comfortable, mismatched home clothes, an oversized, patched sweater, soft trousers, bare feet,\nsubtle radish earrings, a butterbeer cork necklace,\n(sitting on a worn armchair in a cozy, eccentrically decorated living room:1.1) in the Lovegood home,\nsunlight streaming through a window, cluttered with whimsical, homemade artifacts, stacks of books and scrolls,\nsoft natural light, warm and inviting atmosphere, deep depth of field,\na faint, whimsical glow around her,\n(holding a Quibbler magazine:1.0) or an unusual magical artifact"],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"}],"links":[[3,4,1,6,0,"CLIP"],[5,4,1,7,0,"CLIP"],[10,4,0,10,0,"MODEL"],[11,6,0,10,1,"CONDITIONING"],[12,7,0,10,2,"CONDITIONING"],[13,10,0,11,3,"LATENT"],[14,12,0,11,0,"MODEL"],[19,12,1,15,0,"CLIP"],[20,12,1,16,0,"CLIP"],[23,15,0,11,1,"CONDITIONING"],[24,16,0,11,2,"CONDITIONING"],[25,11,0,17,0,"LATENT"],[27,5,0,10,3,"LATENT"],[28,17,0,19,0,"IMAGE"],[34,12,2,17,1,"VAE"],[38,45,0,11,6,"INT"],[41,45,0,10,6,"INT"],[43,47,0,10,11,"INT"],[44,47,0,11,10,"INT"],[45,51,0,6,1,"STRING"],[46,50,0,7,1,"STRING"],[47,51,0,15,1,"STRING"],[48,50,0,16,1,"STRING"]],"groups":[{"id":1,"title":"Base Prompt","bounding":[281.707763671875,-128.8721160888672,439.7534484863281,600.5301513671875],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":2,"title":"Refiner Prompt","bounding":[285.9026794433594,567.3108520507812,442.127685546875,588.2311401367188],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":4,"title":"Load in BASE SDXL Model","bounding":[-100,-130,359.4917907714844,403.9964904785156],"color":"#a1309b","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":5,"title":"Load in REFINER SDXL Model","bounding":[-95.2878189086914,564.1364135742188,361.54791259765625,403.3152160644531],"color":"#a1309b","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":6,"title":"Empty Latent Image","bounding":[-115.09705352783203,-652.1575317382812,353.29144287109375,461.8235168457031],"color":"#a1309b","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":7,"title":"VAE Decoder","bounding":[1165.2672119140625,521.2222900390625,358.535400390625,332.57080078125],"color":"#b06634","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":8,"title":"Step Control","bounding":[266.23602294921875,-652.185302734375,274.54791259765625,472.66363525390625],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":10,"title":"Text Prompts","bounding":[-471.7359313964844,-166.89599609375,339,622],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":11,"title":"Base","bounding":[-110,-173.60000610351562,1228.77294921875,655.2579956054688],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}},{"id":12,"title":"Refiner","bounding":[-105.2878189086914,520.5363159179688,1234.4083251953125,645.005615234375],"color":"#3f789e","font_size":24,"flags":{}}],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":0.78,"offset":[857.9307421695735,398.7554647954203]},"frontendVersion":"1.18.9"},"version":0.4}
